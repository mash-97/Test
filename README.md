# Current State

This app is in it's infancy state and NOT USUABLE. It was like a project for the purpose of getting myself dripped into the pyqt5.
Well! I tried to complete it as usuable as possible. But I'm soaked into something I no longer feel myself to do it anymore now, maybe later I'll
soak myself into it in future again. Because the main reason is the structure of the development of this app that I was going along is hard to extend.
So I have to think about it thorougly again and rebase the structure, until then I'll try to gain knowledge, resources, tools, STYLES etc on agile development and it will be remained as an Application Idea.
